# Memolution
You can take notes as often as you breathes.

## Description
Memolution helps you take notes because
- when you start this app, keyboad always appears. 
- voice input eliminates the need for annoying keyboarding and you can make the same label notes at high speed.
- push notification always reminds you of what you have to do or you don't want to miss.
